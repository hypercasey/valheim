# valheim
A set of tools for running Valheim servers in an OCI containerized/pod environment.

I wrote most of this software in a paranoid and manic altered state of consciousness as is legally required for my medical conditions as a combat veteran struggling in the survival against PTSD, so I'll go ahead and write some instructions once I can afford my medications again so that I remember whatever it was I was trying to do in the first place. I can't work because I can't afford my medications because nobody hires us veterans who can't afford to work. It's a weird paradox/conundrum, but I guess that's life.
