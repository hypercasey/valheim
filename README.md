# valheim
A set of tools for running Valheim servers in an OCI containerized/pod environment.

Disclaimer:
  I wrote most of this software in a paranoid and manic altered state of consciousness as is legally required for my medical conditions as a combat veteran struggling in the survival against PTSD, so I'll go ahead and write some instructions once I can afford my medications again so that I remember whatever it was I was trying to do in the first place.

Instructions:
  You will need to run these scripts as needed to simplify running Valheim in a pod/OCI compliant container. You can probably determine which order to run them in if you are familiar with running pods/containers because they were generally named after the basic OCI compliant commands.
  
Reasoning:
  Valheim "save freezes" unless you run it on a remote server. This is a really annoying problem with the game, which triggered my PTSD so bad I turned around and wrote thousands of lines of code and spent like $100 on server costs to get around it before getting bored with the game and moving on completely due to lack of new content. I just... I don't know why I bother doing things anymore. First Valheim, and now Stadia... I'm done.
